            <h1>Holland Lop Rabbits</h1>
            <p>
				The breed and how to manage its grooming and feeding .The things to lookout for and my experience.Details on what they’re like and the size they get and how much room they’ll need.
The Holland lop originated in the Netherlands. These rabbits are very sweet. I feel out of all of the breed of rabbit I’ve had these were the most gentle. Just like any other rabbit there still skittish but a skittish that makes them more cuddly. You can distinguish these rabbits by their flat years and smaller bodies. For food they have a gentle pallet that consists of Timothy hay and pellets just like any other rabbit though you can still give them small amounts of fruit but I wouldn’t recommend acidic fruits. Vegetables are good in a certain amount but not more than your Timothy hay which you would want in large amounts for your rabbit. For these rabbits they don’t require grooming so taking care of their for is very simple.
