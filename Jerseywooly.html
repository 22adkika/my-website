				The breed and how to manage its grooming and feeding .The things to lookout for and my experience.Details on what they’re like and the size they get and how much room they’ll need.
The origin of the jersey wooly bunny is in New Jersey. These rabbits are also generally happy rabbits but some males can be feisty. Females are usually more sweet and good-natured rabbit where as the Males are more territorial so in my case I was bit a few times but that’s not our rabbits that are male of this breed. For food you want to give them pellets with lots of nutrients but not too much about half a cup as well but more Timothy hay. These rabbits have more hearty stomachs so I would even give my rabbits yogurt or yogurt balls that come in your local pet stores. I still would not recommend giving them very acidic fruits because it’s harsh on their stomach and you cannot give them nuts.For grooming them they have lots of fut. They cannot go long periods of time without being cleaned because the for could possibly clog up their stomach and cause discomfort. For these rabbits if they have large mats you can either brush them out or just trim them because they’re for grows back so fast you can’t notice the patches of missing fur.
