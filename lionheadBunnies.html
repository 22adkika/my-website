 The breed and how to manage its grooming and feeding .The things to lookout for and my experience.Details on what they’re like and the size they get and how much room they’ll need.
The lion head rabbit was originally created in Belgium. These rabbits have wooly manes that distinguish the
breed. I’ve owned a total of five lionhead rabbits and they all had fairly kind demeanors. They’re a very good natured breed.
 For feeding them they’re fairly small but timothy hay is a necessity for there teeth. A rabbits teeth actually never stop growing things like hay, salt cubes, or wood help to file the teeth for better use and to keep your rabbit healthy. In particular, timothy hay is probably the best thing for you rabbits diet. If you give your lion head pellets, only give then half a cup a day with small amounts of fruit.
 When taking care of your lionhead also take into consideration their hair. For grooming you really only have to cut back the hair on their face and if you see knotted up areas in the fur just use a dog brush and a small toothed comb to brush it out. This will keep your bunny looking clean and healthy.
