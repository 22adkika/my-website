            <h2>Rabbits and how to maintain them</h2>
            <p>
                Rabbits are fairly common pets for lots of people but here are a handful of things to know first. If you didn&#39;t know there are lots and lots of different breeds of rabbit that vary in size. They&#39;re very smart and some breeds you can even litterbox train. I myself can claim to this because i&#39;ve litterbot trained many bunnies. It saves certain hastles with cleaning out the cage but can take effort from the pet owner. I really just love all my animals to the fullest and take full force when i bring a new pet into my home. I&#39;ve had a total of six rabbits that I&#39;ve owned and taken care of as pets. I&#39;ve also been in contact with many different breeders who had different selections of breed. I found that smaller breeds were more skittish at first but if you handle them enough they grow fond of you and create a bond. Once your pet trusts you owning your rabbit is great.
