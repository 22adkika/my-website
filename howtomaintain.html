        <p>  Rabbits are fairly common pets for lots of people but here are a handful of things to know first. If you didnt know there are lots and lots of different breeds of rabbit that vary in size. They're very smart and some breeds you can even litterbox train. I myself can claim to this because ive litterbox trained many bunnies. It saves certain hastles with cleaning out the cage but can take effort from the pet owner. I really just love all my animals to the fullest and take full force when I bring a new pet into my home. Ive had a total of six rabbits that Ive owned and taken care of as pets. Ive also been in contact with many different breeders who had different selections of breed. I found that smaller breeds were more skittish at first but if you handle them enough they grow fond of you and create a bond. Once your pet trusts you owning your rabbit is great.</p>

    <li><h2>Food</h2>All breed types need food and it’s reconmended to give all rabbits food multiple times a day. Treat them like they’re more fradgile than dogs or cats because they’re organs are small.</li>
    <li><h2>Shelter</h2>The container they’re held in should be substantially larger than the rabbit its self.They should have enough room to run and to be more used to a person you have to hold them alot the first couple of weeks.</li>
    <li><h2>Grooming</h2>Grooming is different for all breeds but base the grooming of the length of the hair. If your rabbit has longer hair you should groom more often so your pet doesn’t get knots.</li>
