<h1>Rabbits and how to maintain them</h1>
<p>Rabbits are fairly common pets for lots of people but here are a handful of things to know first. If you didn’t know there are lots and lots of different breeds of rabbit that vary in size. They’re very smart and some breeds you can even litterbox train. I myself can claim to this because i’ve litterbot trained many bunnies. It saves certain hastles with cleaning out the cage but can take effort from the pet owner. I really just love all my animals to the fullest and take full force when i bring a new pet into my home. I’ve had a total of six rabbits that I’ve owned and taken care of as pets. I’ve also been in contact with many different breeders who had different selections of breed. I found that smaller breeds were more skittish at first but if you handle them enough they grow fond of you and create a bond. Once your pet trusts you owning your rabbit is great.
